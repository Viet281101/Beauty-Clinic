### Requirements:
1. **Develop and build the webpage with absolute precision.**
   - Focus on creating a **well-structured and highly reusable codebase**.
   - Learn and apply **TailwindCSS**, **styled-components**, and **twin.macro** to style the application. Use these tools to replace plain CSS. You can convert the previously written plain CSS into these modern styling methods.

   - Use Jotai/Redux for state management.
   - Ensure responsiveness across all pages.
   - Note:
      - The navbar requires creativity to achieve a good UI/UX.
      - Pay attention to the consistency of newly added components (not included in the current design) with the overall design.

2. **Deployment:**
   - After completing the project, deploy the website using one of the following platforms:
     - [Vercel Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview)
     - [Netlify Deployment](https://www.netlify.com/)
     - [GitHub Actions Deployment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/about-deployments/deploying-with-github-actions)
