Build the **Home1 page** in Beauty Clinic using the **ReactJS library**:

### Requirements:
1. **Develop and build the webpage with absolute precision.**
   - **Suggestion:** Reuse code from **Exercise 0** as a starting point.
   - Focus on creating a **well-structured and highly reusable codebase**.
   - Learn and apply **TailwindCSS**, **styled-components**, and **twin.macro** to style the application. Use these tools to replace plain CSS. You can convert the previously written plain CSS into these modern styling methods.

2. **Deployment:**
   - After completing the project, deploy the website using one of the following platforms:
     - [Vercel Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview)
     - [Netlify Deployment](https://www.netlify.com/)
